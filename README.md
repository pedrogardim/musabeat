### About this project

Musabeat is a React web app that implements the core features of a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), such as:

- Instruments and audio tracks
- Musical events scheduling
- Sequencer and Piano Roll editor
- Synthesis (Subtractive, FM, etc)
- Sampling
- Audio recording and playback
- Sound effects and processors (Equivalent to Plug-ins / VSTs)
- Mixing

In addition to that, it features:

- Authentication
- A "cloud" system (Users sessions, files and instruments patches are stored on a database, and can be accesed from anywhere)
- Real-time collaborative music creation, users can edit and listen to the same session at the same time.
- Basic social system (Likes, profiles, sharing)
- Multilanguage
- Dark / Light theme.

It relies on the WebAudio API (wrapped by ToneJS), React for the UI, and Firebase for database and storage.

**The project has been discontinued, so you may found some bugs :)**

### Some Background

This app was born as a challenge during my Audio Engineering VT (and ended up being my degree project), as an opportunity to improve and implement my web development skills in addition to my recent obtained digital audio knowledge. 

Looking back to the code almost two years after I started this project, I'm happy to see the progress I made both in React and general Javascript good practices. 

### Future of the project

I'm not really working on Musabeat anymore. It would take some serious re-design for it to be a real commercial product. Features started to add up and the app ended up being a really complex product for beginners to use. Also, WebAudio performance started to be a problem when using too many tracks.

Nonetheless, in the future, I have plans of picking and improving some of its main features, and create a simpler and more minimalist app, with a better UX and focused on creativity and just creating music.
